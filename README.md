## Getting Started

To set up the Blazor Mudblazor Starter project on your local machine, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if you plan to run in a container)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonathanperis/blazor-mudblazor-starter.git
   cd blazor-mudblazor-starter
   ```

2. **Restore NuGet packages:**

   Navigate to the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

---

## Running the Application

The application can be run in multiple modes. Choose the one best fitting your setup:

- **Blazor Server Mode:**
  ```bash
  dotnet run --project WebClient.csproj
  ```
- **Blazor WebAssembly Mode:**
  ```bash
  dotnet run --project WebClient.csproj
  ```

Upon running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port indicated in your console).

## Configuration and Customization

### Application Settings

Configuration files are available to help customize your deployment:
- *appsettings.json*: Main configuration for global settings.
- *appsettings.Development.json*: Developer-specific overrides for local testing.
- *Dockerfile*: Predefined instructions for containerized deployments.

### Theme and UI Customization

Mudblazor makes UI customizations straightforward:
- Navigate to `wwwroot/css/` to modify or extend styles.
- Override or add new theming variables within your component files.
